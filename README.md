# Ionic-Project
A dummy Restaurant App

Its and Angular and Ionic Project

System Requirements:-
node. npm, angular, ionic and cordova to be installed. i have used bower to install these on my desktop.

i have used ionic sidemenu template to create the app and use ionic serve --lab command to review the app and changes made.

There are two folders - conFusion and json-server. The json-server contains db.json file with the restaurant data accessible 
at following link and contains the images folder with images used in the app.
http://localhost:3000/dishes

The www folder inside the conFusion folder contains the necessary files for the app.

This is my first Angular-Ionic project. The App is still in-progress mode.
